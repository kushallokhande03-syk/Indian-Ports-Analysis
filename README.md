⚓ Indian Port Analysis
📘 Project Overview

The Indian Port Analysis project is a structured SQL-based analytical system that simulates real-world maritime operations in India. It models major ports, ships, docking schedules, and cargo movements to enable comprehensive data exploration and performance insights.

This project focuses on understanding port efficiency, cargo handling trends, and ship operations using SQL queries and relational database design.

🧱 Database Design

The database includes four main entities:

Ports – Contains details of major Indian ports, their capacities, states, and operational status.

Ships – Includes ship information such as type, capacity, flag country, and year built.

Docking_Schedule – Tracks ship arrivals, departures, berth assignments, and operational status.

Cargo – Logs cargo types and tonnage handled per docking event.

🔍 Key Analytical Queries

The SQL script answers several business questions, such as:

Distinct ports per state (e.g., Gujarat).

Highest container handling capacity among Indian ports.

Total container cargo handled by Gujarat ports.

Scheduled international container ships.

Ships with missing berth numbers or active docking status.

State-wise port capacity analysis.

Identifying the oldest Indian container ship and average TEU capacity.

🧠 Key Learnings

Designing relational databases with foreign key constraints.

Handling NULL values and duplicate records.

Performing aggregation, filtering, and joins for data insights.

Applying real-world business logic to maritime datasets using SQL.

🛠️ Tools Used
